## Project Structure

The front-end combines html,css, javascript and bootstrap. This was an already existing template which is 
free to use modify, update , clean for your personal project. 

Check the .gitignore file to see all the files and folders that will be ignore because some are auto-generated by the IDE, log files, editor files and folders etc.

### Folders you will be working with are:

- <b>models/</b> contains the database schema, scripts to interact the db and cache data

- <b>public/</b> hooks the DOM

- <b>views/</b> contains the <b>admin/</b> (contains static files such as images, js etc), <b>home/</b> (contains the reusable components)

, <b>layout/</b>(which also contains base structure) and <b>views/</b>(which contains the <b>screens/</b> with pop up screens and other frontend)

### Files you will be working with:

- <b>Routes </b> renders the routes

- <b>model.js</b> contains the electron main process and also all screens config goes here

- <b>App.js (app.js)</b> root of the application
